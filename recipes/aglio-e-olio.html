        <h2>A classic italian pasta dish that takes 10 minutes to make</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.” The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients. It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes, but even these are optional.</p>
        <p>Aglio e olio is a little spicy. It's herbaceous, thanks to the parsley. The garlic flavor is there. The pasta is coated with the emulsified sauce, not oily at all. Once you start cooking, this is not something you can walk away from.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 lbs of dried spaguetti</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of good extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>8 large garlic cloves, cut into thin slivers</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced fresh parsely</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, plus extra for plating</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt and the pasta and cook according to the directions on the package. Set aside 1 1/2 cups of the pasta cooking water before you drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium heat in a pot large enough to hold the pasta, such as a 12-inch saute pan or a large, shallow pot. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until it just begins to turn golden on the edges-don't overcook it! Add the red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds more. Carefully add the reserved pasta-cooking water to the garlic and oil and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, add 1 teaspoon of salt, and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the liquid is reduced by about a third.</li>
            <li>Add the drained pasta to the garlic sauce and toss. Off the heat, add the parsley and Parmesan and toss well. Allow the pasta to rest off the heat for 5 minutes for the sauce to be absorbed. Taste for seasoning and serve warm with extra Parmesan on the side.</li>
        </ol>

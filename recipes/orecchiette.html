        <h2>A classic italian pasta with some spice</h2>
        <p>Orecchiette are a pasta typical of Apulia, a region of Southern Italy. Their name comes from their shape, which resembles a small ear.</p>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 bunches broccoli rabe approximately 1½-2 pounds, trimmed and washed</li>
            <li>1 pound orecchiette pasta 1 package (454 grams)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil extra virgin</li>
            <li>½ pound Italian sausage spicy or sweet, casings removed, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 french shallot finely chopped</li>
            <li>4-6 garlic cloves roughly chopped</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup white wine</li>
            <li>reserved pasta water</li>
            <li>¼ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese grated</li>
            <li>¼ cup Pecorino Romano Cheese grated</li>
            <li>grated cheese to garnish top optional</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Over high heat, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Add the broccoli rabe. Return to a boil and cook for an additional 3 minutes or until the stalks are tender.</li>
            <li>With a slotted spoon, remove from boiling water and place in a colander to drain. Gently squeeze out excess moisture. Coarsely chop into 1-inch bite-sized pieces. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same large pot of boiling water, slowly add 1 pound of orecchiette pasta and stir continuously for one minute. Cook according to package directions until almost al dente</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a very large saucepan, over medium-high heat. Swirl to coat the entire pan.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped shallots and saute until beginning to soften about 2-3 minutes. Stir often.</li>
            <li>Add  ½ pound of crumbled Italian sausage (spicy or sweet). With a wooden spoon, break up the meat into small pieces, about ¼- ½  inch pieces, until lightly browned. This should take about 5 minutes. If necessary, adjust the heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped garlic and ¼ teaspoon of red pepper flakes (or to taste) and sauté for 30-45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the white wine and deglaze the pan.</li>
            <li>Lower heat to medium-low and add the cooked chopped broccoli rabe. Combine properly together. If too dry, add a little of the pasta water.  Adjust seasonings.</li>
            <li>At this time, the pasta should be almost al dente.  Reserve a cup of the pasta water. Drain and add to the saucepan. Combine gently together.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat off.  Add a little of the hot pasta water and the grated cheese and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Toss and shake the pan back and forth for 1-2 minutes, until a sauce forms.</li>
            <li>If necessary, adjust the consistency of the sauce with the rest of the cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Plate and garnish with more grated cheese, if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
